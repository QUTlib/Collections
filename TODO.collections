get_parent_collections could be done a lot better.

do we need the is collection method? do we actually want the EPrints::DataObj::EPrint methods to check is_collection? they are only convinence methods anyway. Maybe people want to be able to turn existing objects into collections? scarey but i think it should be enforced at the interface level not the dataobj.
